Notes for Things to be Included in the Report

Histogram similarity measure
- Decide on distance algorithm:
	- Euclidean distance might be faster
	- Chi-squared usually works better
	- Try both and see difference in results/computation time
- How many bins?
	- 256 gives best result but takes time
	- fewer bins means coarser representation
