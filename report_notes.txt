Notes for Things to be Included in the Report

Histogram similarity measure
- Decide on distance algorithm:
	- Euclidean distance might be faster
	- Chi-squared usually works better
	- Try both and see difference in results/computation time
- How many bins?
	- 256 gives best result but takes time
	- fewer bins means coarser representation

ChiSquared
	- 97.103s
	- 250 images
	- 256 bins
	- 100x100

Euclidean 
	- 72.445s
	- 250 images
	- 256 bins
	- 100x100

ChiSquared
	- 82.199s
	- 250 images
	- 100 bins
	- 100x100

Euclidean 
	- 62.848s
	- 250 images
	- 100 bins
	- 100x100

k-NN
	- No explicit training step is required (training is just storing position and label of image)
	- Change value of k and estimate difference in time
